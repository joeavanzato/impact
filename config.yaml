      trying to do this, either it will be your IT guys or a recovery agency.
      
      Please follow these simple rules to avoid data corruption:
      
      - Do not modify, rename or delete files.  Any attempts to modify, decrypt ot rename the files will lead to its fatal corruption.
      
      - Do not hire a recovery company.  They can't decrypt without the key.
      They also don't care about your business.  They believe that they are good negotiators, but it is not.  
      They usually fail.  So speak for yourself.

      - Tor Browser Links: http://ransomxifxwc5eteopdobynonjctkxxvap77yqifu2emfbecgbqdw6qd.onion/
      
        Want to go to authorities for protection
      - Seeking their help will only make the situation worse,They will try to prevent you from negotiating with us, because the negotiations will make them look incompetent,After the incident report is handed over to the government department, you will be fined ,The government uses your fine to reward them.And you will not get anything, and except you and your company, the rest of the people will forget what happened
        Think you can handle it without us by decrypting your servers and data using some IT Solution from third-party "specialists"
      - they will only make significant damage to all of your data
        every encrypted file will be corrupted forever. Only our Decryption Tool will make decryption guaranteed
        Think your partner IT Recovery Company will do files restoration
      - no they will not do restoration, only take 3-4 weeks for nothing
        besides all of your data is on our servers and we can publish it at any time
        as well as send the info about the data breach from your company servers to your key partners and clients, competitors, media and youtubers, etc.
        Those actions from our side towards your company will have irreversible negative consequences for your business reputation.
        You don't care in any case, because you just don't want to pay
      - We will make you business stop forever by using all of our experience to make your partners, clients, employees and whoever cooperates with your company change their minds by having no choice but to stay away from your company.
        As a result, in midterm you will have to close your business.
        So lets get straight to the point.
      
      What do we offer in exchange on your payment:
        - decryption and restoration of all your systems and data within 24 hours with guarantee
        - never inform anyone about the data breach out from your company
        - after data decryption and system restoration, we will delete all of your data from your servers forever
        - provide valuable advising on your company IT protection so no one can attack your again.
      
      Now, in order to start negotiations, you need to do the following:
        - install and run 'Tor Browser' from https://www.torproject.org/download/
        - use 'Tor Browser' open http://sdhipwlqmxv7k4wgrrvhjfwpwapa3uxudtl5otkm757q5jyvl7gk5nqd.onion/
        - enter your Client ID: %R%R%R%R%R-%R%R%R-%R%R%R-%R%R%R%R%R
        There will be no bad news for your company after successful negotiations for both sides. But there will be plenty of those bad news if case of failed negotiations, so don't think about how to avoid it.
      Just focus on negotiations, payment and decryption to make all of your problems solved by our specialists within 1 day after payment received: servers and data restored, everything will work good as new.

      Hello!
      
      If you are reading this, it means that your system were hit by Royal ransomware.
      Please csontact us via:
      royal2xthig3ou5hd7zsliqagy6yygk2cdelaxtni2fyad6dpmpxedid.onion
      
      In the meantime, let us explain this case. It may seem complicated, but it is not!
      Most likely what happened was that you decided to save some money on your security infrastructure.
      Alas, as a result your critical data was not only encrypted but also copied from your system on a secure server.
      From there it can be published online. Then anyone on the internet from darknet criminals, ACLU journalists, Chinese government(different names for the same thing),
      and even your employees will be able to see your internal documentation: personal data, HR reviews, internal lawsuits and complaints, financial reports, accounting, intellectual property and more!
      
      Fortunately we got you covered!
      
      Royal offers you a unique deal. For a modest royalty (got it; got it ?) for our pentesting services we will not only provide you with an amazing risk mitigation service,
      covering you from reputational, legal, financial and insurance risks, but will also provide you with a security review for your systems.
      
      To put it simply, your files will be decrypted, your data restored and kept confidential, and your systems will stay in safe.
      
      Contact us through TOR browser using the link:
